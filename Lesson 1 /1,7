One of the main syntax rules in HTML are :
1) <> and </> are called a tag, <> is called an opening tag,
and </> is called a closing tag.
2) <p></p>, p inside the opening tag and the closing tag is
called a tag or an element name.
3) <p>Hello, world!</p>, The text inside <p></p> is called a
content or an inner text.
4) <p>Hello, world!</p>, The whole code is called an HTML element.
5) <p>
     Hello, world!
   </p>
  In this code, if we want to write the code like this (easier
  to read), we must press a tab (or 2 spaces) before the text.
  This is called an indent.
6) <p>Hello, world!</p>, Always write the tag name (element name)
lowercase, not UPPERCASE.
